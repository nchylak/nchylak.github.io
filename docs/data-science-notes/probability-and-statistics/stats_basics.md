# Basics

## Branches in statistics

**Design**: planning and carrying out research studies

**Description**: Exploring and summarizing data

**Inference**: Making predictions and generalizations about phenomena observed in the data

## Population vs sample

**Population**: Group that the researcher wishes to study. The population represents the target of investigation.

**Sample**: A group of individuals selected from the population. Descriptive statistics describe the sample.

**Simple random sample (SRS)**: Each item in the population has an equal chance of being chosen.

## Data types

### Categorical data

**Nominal data**: non-quantitive (“labels”) and have no order

**Ordinal data**: non-quantitive (“labels”) and have an order

### Numerical data

**Discrete data**: can only take on certain values (e.g. counts)

**Continuous data**: can take on every value

## Random variable

$$X$$: Random variable

$$x$$: Realization of a random variable
