# Amazon Redshift

* Cloud managed: No need to worry about scalability, up-front costs, hardware maintenance, etc.
* Column-oriented: Optimised for OLAP operations / analytics as well as for compression thanks to columnar storage
* Massively parallel processing: Queries are executed on multiple CPUs/machines
* Supports infrastructure as code (IaC)
